 Less  is a program similar to more (1), but it has many more features.  Less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, 
 so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.

Commands:
f, Ctrl + F ==>  Scroll forward
b,  Ctrl + B ==> Scroll backward
Enter ==> next line
j ==> next line
k ==> previous line
q ==> quit
